Tweepy_verified: [Server-side script]

Simple script to extract Filtered tweets using tweepy's Streaming API.
The script filters tweets which have data for verified sources of vital resources.
Vital sources are filtered using keywords given in tweets_sequence
The script can run forever in async mode but I have added a cap of 200 tweets after which the script will terminate with an option to send the collated data over mail to example@something.com
Tweets and retweets are separated into two different CSV files

query.py: [Client-side script]

Tweepy_verified.py extracts a lot of data. We use query.py to extract specific details of a particular vital source.
You can use following command to understand how query.py works:
python query.py -h
The script will generate the required output in Required_details.csv in the same folder

Typical use case: If we want to search for oxygen cylinders:
python query.py -l oxygen -c ./Retweets.csv

Here, Retweets.csv is the file which is generated by Tweepy_verified.py
